Challenge 1

1.  Write a c++ program called 'hello.cpp' to print "Hello World" 
completely from memory, using Vim. Compile it and run it.

2.  do a "git status" to see the state of your repository. you should 
see the file as untracked because git hasn't seen this file before.

2.  in git, "add" the program file as a tracked file. Check the git 
status to see the new state of the file.

3.  in git, "commit" the program file so that it is officially saved.  
Your workspace now had an committed file and is considered "ahead" 
of the repository; you can see this with git status.

4.  in git, "push" your workspace so that the master repositry gets 
your file.  now see what git status says.
